###Lab Overview

This lab is designed to provide you with experience using the pulse-width modulation features of the MSP430. You will need to program the MSP430 to generate pulse-width-modulated waveforms to control the speed / direction of your robot's motors. In this lab, you will make your robot move forward, backwards, a small (< 45 degree) turn left/right, and a large (> 45 dgree) turn left/right.

###Driving Motors

There were two motor used in the lab, one for each wheel. The amount of torque provided by the motor was directly proportional to the amount of voltage provided. A positive voltage would move the wheel forward, a negative voltage would move it in reverse.

###Prelab

See attached Prelab. 

###Required Functionality

The prelab I did was not too helpful because i don't think I went about doing it properly. Dr Coulston ended up drawing a useful schematic in class one day, so I ended up basing the design off of that. A lot of other people seemed to do the same, so I thought that if I ran into any problems, it would be helpful that we had the same starting approach.

Afterwards, The robot was relatively easy to hook up, I ended up using capacitors to help get a steady signal and reduce voltage fluctuations. The actual robot layout can be seen below. This same design layout was used for the A functionality part of the lab since the IR sensor was easy to install and did not affect the Required functionality part of the lab. I ended up writing one function at a time and testing it to see if it worked. Afterwards I just stacked commands together to achieve the required functionality.
